## Netlify Deployment

### Current Status: ✅ FIXED

The build issues have been resolved. The team page now:

1. **Loads immediately** with hardcoded team data
2. **Updates dynamically** with Sanity images in the background
3. **Never hangs** or gets stuck in loading states
4. **Works without Sanity** if environment variables are missing

### Environment Variables (Optional)

To enable Sanity image updates, add these to your Netlify dashboard:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2024-01-01
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### How It Works Now

- **Build Time**: No Sanity operations, page builds successfully
- **Runtime**: Sanity images load in background if configured
- **Fallback**: Always shows team data, even without Sanity
- **Performance**: Fast loading with no hanging states

### Testing

1. **Local Development**: `npm run dev` - works with or without Sanity
2. **Netlify Build**: `npm run build` - builds successfully every time
3. **Production**: Sanity updates happen in background if configured

The page is now production-ready and will deploy successfully to Netlify!
